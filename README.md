# 1) TSP Djibouti 

## Problem Statement: What is the fastest way to move accross all 38 cities in Djibouti ?

### Simulated Annealing and the Genetic algorithm are compared to see which gives the best fitness 

    Two types of cooling methods were used and compared (Exponential and Arithmatic) for simulated annealing. The best 
    fitness value yielded by the the two cooling methods (for simulated annealing) will be chosen and compared with the 
    best fitness value from the genetic algorithm. 

    I used jupyter notebook to run my code. The following figure shows the importing of relavant packages and initilizations.
